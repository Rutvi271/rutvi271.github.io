    <h3>
      <li>The task was given to me to make 8x8 led matrix which can display things we want.</li>
<li>The system used in traffic signals and on railway station to show schedule of trains works on this principle.</li>
</h3>
</ul>

<p><h2 align="center">Step-1</h2>

  <ul>
    <h3>
<li>First  I  started  with  watching  videos  and  gathering  information  about   the  components  I would  require.</li>
<li>I  started  with  collecting  64  led's  and  checking  them  if  they  are  working  properly  or  not.</li>
<li>I  used  common  row  cathode  method  in which  I  connected  anode (positive)   vertically  and cathode(negative)  horizontally.</li>

</ul>
</p>


<p><h2 align="center">Step-2</h2>

  <ul>
    <p>
    <h3>
<li>I  started  connecting  led's  as  shown  in  circuit.</li></h3></p>
<p align="center"><img  src="img/2-0.jpg" ></p>

<p>
  <h3>
<li>Then  I  started  soldering  it
 horizontally  and then   vertically.</li>
</h3></p>
</ul>

</p>

<p><h2 align="center">Step-3</h2>
  <ul>
    <h3 align="center"><li>Then I added resistors to positive legs that is vertical line.</li></h3>
  </ul>
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="img/6.jpg" ></p>

<ul>
    <h3 align="center"><li>Then  I  connected  horizontal rows  to header  pins.
</li></h3>
  </ul>

</ul>

<p><h2 align="center">Step-4</h2>
  <ul>
    <h3 align="center"><li>Then  I  connected  all  pins  to  arduino  and  uploaded  code.
</li>

  </ul>

<p><h2 align="center">Problems I Faced</h2>
  <ul>
    <h3 ><li>I  faced  problem  after  soldering  as  when  I checked  my  connections  the  soldering  was  not  done  properly.</li>
<li>The  other  thing  was  when  I  first  uploaded  code  it  was  not  working  so  I  thought  there  was  problem  in  connection  but  afterwards  I  realized  there  was  something  wrong  in  program.</li>
</h3>

    <h3 align="center"><li>So  I  uploaded  other  code   and  it  worked..</li>

<p><h2 align="center">Things I Learned</h2>
  <ul><h2>
<li>   First  it  seemed  to be  very  easy  so  I thought  it would  get  complete  in 3  days</li>
<li>But when you  actually  do  it practically  then  you  will know  what  kind  of  problems  come  and  how  time consuming it is..</li>
<li>   How  to  manage  multiple  connection  from  one  arduino.
</li>
<li>How  to  code  multiple  led's.
</li>
<li>How  to  do  trouble  shooting  from  starting  to  end.
