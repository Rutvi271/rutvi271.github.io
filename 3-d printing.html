<h1 align="center"><strong>3-d Pritning</strong></h1>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Step-1</strong></h2>
<h3><p>As 3-d printing week was started we were given task of printing an object which could not be made by substractive method.
	<br> So first task for me was to find out what is additive and substractive method.
	<br></h3>
<h3 align="center">Difference between additive and substractive method.</h3></p>
	<p align="center"><img src="img/3-d.jpg">
	</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Step-2</strong></h2>
<h3><p>Now it was time to search for designs that could be only printed by additive method
	<br>So i went through lot of models and finalized to make gyroscope.</p></h3>

<p><h2 align="center"><strong>Step-3</strong></h2>
<h3 align="center">What is gryoscope and why it is used</h3>
<ul>
<h3><li>As one is making any model one should understand what it is and why it is used.</li></h3>
	<strong> 
<h3><li>Gyroscope is a device consisting of a wheel or disc mounted so that it can spin rapidly about an axis which is itself free to alter in direction.</li></h3>
	</strong>
</ul>
</p>
<p><h2 align="center"><strong>Paper Works</strong></h2>
	<h3><ul>
    	<li>Before doing anything it is necessary to list out things and do layout on paper to do work in proper direction
    	</li>

    <p><br><h2 align="center"> Starting with Designing</h2>
    	<ul>
        	<h3 align="center"><li>I made my First design which look like this but it had lot of flaws</li>
            <br> <li align="center" ><img src="img/3-d1.jpg"></li>
             <br><li>I had kept layer height of 0.2 mm and infill-20% .</li>
             <li>I had kept distance of 0.4mm between hole and cylinder which was too small so it got stuck up with each other.</li>
             <li>I had to stop my first trial print as there was some problem with printer.</li>
             <br><img src="img/3-d2.jpg"><img src="img/3d-3.jpg">
             <br><img src="img/3-d4.jpg">
             <li>As you can see the model was not proper so it broke in some time and colud not spin.


</li></h3>
</ul>
</p>
<br><h2 align="center"><strong>Another Model</strong></h2>
<h3>
<ul>
<li> Noticing the flaws of first model I designed other testing model</li>
<br><li align="center"><img src="img/3-d5.jpg"></li>
<br><li> It got printed well but still it had errors so i went for other testing.</li>
<li align="center"><img src="img/3-d6.jpg"><img src="img/3-d7.jpg"></li>
<li align="center">I changed some parameters. </li>
