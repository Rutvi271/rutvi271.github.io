<h1 align="center"><strong>3-d Pritning</strong></h1>
<h2 align="center"><strong><u>Step-1</u></strong></h2>
<h3><p><ul>
	<li>As 3-d printing week was started we were given task of printing an object which could not be made by substractive method.</li>
	<br><li> So first task for me was to find out what is additive and substractive method.</li>
	</ul></p></h3>
<h3 align="center">Difference between additive and substractive method.</h3></p>
	<p align="center"><img src="img/3-d.jpg">
	</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><u>Step-2</u></strong></h2>
<h3><ul>
	<p><li>Now it was time to search for designs that could be only printed by additive method.</li>
	<br><li>So i went through lot of models and finalized to make gyroscope.</li></p>
	<li>Some of the designs which i went through were following.</li>

</ul></h3>

<h2 align="center"><strong><u>Step-3</u></strong></h2>
<h2 align="center"><strong>What is gryoscope and why it is used</strong></h2>
<ul>
<h3><li>As one is making any model one should understand what it is and why it is used.</li></h3>
	<strong> 
<h3><li>Gyroscope is a device consisting of a wheel or disc mounted so that it can spin rapidly about an axis which is itself free to alter in direction and it could not be made by substracting method.</li></h3>
	</strong>
</ul>

   <h2 align="center"><u>Starting 3-d print</u></h2>
   	<ul>
<h3><p><li>In our lab we had ultimaker 2 so for that first of all i installed cura to operate it.</li></p></h3></ul>

	</ul>
<ul>
	<p>
<h3><li>So first of all for testing printer we printed robot.</li></h3>
	<li ><IMG SRC="img/bot.jpg"></IMG></li>
 </p></ul>

	<ul>
	<p><h3><li>Then rutuja took a short session on how to set the basic parameters so that print can be done effectively and in short time
	</li></h3></p>
</ul>



	<p><h2 align="center"><strong>Paper Works</strong></h2>
	<h3><ul>
    	<li>Before doing anything it is necessary to list out things and do layout on paper to do work in proper direction.
    	</li>
    	<li>So first design the model and list down dimension to understand proper working.</li>

</ul>

    <p><br><u><h2 align="center"> Starting with Designing</h2></u>
    	<ul>
        	<h3>I made my First design which look like this but it had lot of flaws
             <li><img src="img/3-d1.jpg"></li>
             <br><li>I had kept layer height of 0.2 mm and infill-20% .</li>
             <li>I had kept distance of 0.4mm between hole and cylinder which was too small so it got stuck up with each other.</li>
             <li>I had to stop my first trial print as there was some problem with printer.</li>
             <br><img src="img/3-d2.jpg"><img src="img/3d-3.jpg">
             <br><img src="img/3-d4.jpg">
             <li>As you can see the model was not proper so it broke in some time and could not spin.


</li></h3>
</ul>
</p>
<br><h2 align="center"><strong>Another Model</strong></h2>
<h3>
<ul>
<li> Noticing the flaws of first model I designed other testing model</li>
<br><li align="center"><img src="img/3-d5.jpg"></li>
<br><li> It got printed well but still it had errors so i went for other testing.</li>
<li align="center"><img src="img/3-d6.jpg"><img src="img/3-d7.jpg"></li>
<li align="center">I changed some parameters. </li>

</ul>

</p>

<p><h2 align="center"> <strong>Final Design</strong></h2>

<h3><ul>
	<li>I designed my final print .</li>
	<li>But it is still not upto the mark of quality and smoothness that was needed.</li>
	<h3 align="center"><img src="img/ss1.jpg"><img src="img/ss2.jpg"></h3>



</ul></h3>

	</p>
<p>
<h2 align="center"><strong >Errors and Learning</strong></h2>
<ul><h3 align="center">
<li>We learned lot of new things like different parameters and its effect in printing.</li>
<li>We learned how to do bed aligning when it does not print properly</li>
<li>We also explored cad with 3-d printing</li>
